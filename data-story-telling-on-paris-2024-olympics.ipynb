I looked at it from few point of views (POV) <br> \n","1. from Events POV <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ranked events based on the occurrence. Most events are Athletics events since it bins all track and field events, followed by swimming. <br>\n","\n","2. from Schedule POV <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Time series plot to see total events everyday and cumulative event to understand percentage completion each day.\n","<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comapred with Basketball event schedule and trend is highly correlated\n","\n","3. from Overall Athletes POV <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Identified that we had a 12 year and 70 year old athlete competiting, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most athletes are part of track and field discipline, followed by swimming, football. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gender parity is not a lot in top ten Countries in terms of total athletes representing their country but overall there were more male athletes than female atheletes. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most common age of the player is 27 and variance of age across gender is almost similar with little difference. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Interesting find was that Variance of athletes coming from China is low, lowest age being 12 and highest age being 37. <br>\n","4. from Medals POV<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Interesting identification was seeing various athletes like Yufei Zhang winning multiple medals. <br>\n","5.  from 1 athletes POV- Novak Djokovic<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is how I as a viewer most of the times watch it. I am a fan of Novak Djokovic and seeing him win his 1st Gold medal in his possibly last Olympics was very satisfying. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scatter plot to visualize his journey towards that Gold medal and athletes he played along the way."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"220a3afa","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.014769,"end_time":"2024-12-09T21:23:51.609267","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-12-09T21:23:51.594498","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":[]}],"metadata":{"kaggle":{"accelerator":"none","dataSources":[{"datasetId":5274150,"sourceId":9262003,"sourceType":"datasetVersion"}],"dockerImageVersionId":30761,"isGpuEnabled":false,"isInternetEnabled":true,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.14"},"papermill":{"default_parameters":{},"duration":38.962074,"end_time":"2024-12-09T21:23:52.445639","environment_variables":{},"exception":null,"input_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","output_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","parameters":{},"start_time":"2024-12-09T21:23:13.483565","version":"2.6.0"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
